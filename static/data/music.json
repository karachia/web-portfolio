		"description": "\"Stranger of Kin\", inspired by my grandmother's Alzheimer's disease, which progressively worsened over the course of nine years, explores the complex emotions that arise when a loved one experiences memory loss. Our interactions are a mix of love, sadness at her moments of forgetfulness, and frustration when the same questions, like \"who are you?\", repeat. There are brief moments of joy, too, as she recalls a childhood memory of when she helped raise me like a second mother. But these precious moments are fleeting, and the cycle of confusion and questioning begins anew.\n\n At the same time, I imagine my grandmother feels fear and disorientation when she doesn't recognize her surroundings or the people around her. It must be a disorienting whirlwind for her, forced to rely on the explanations of a stranger (me) to understand her reality. However, when a fragment of memory returns, there's a bittersweet acceptance for both of us. We accept that the situation is beyond our control, and all we can offer each other is love, sympathy, and cherishing these precious moments while they last.\n\n The music seeks to capture such complex emotions surrounding my interactions with my grandmother in a cyclical fashion. Each cycle presents the same musical material but each time in a different character, color, and/or textures and eventually is interrupted by a dreamy but abrupt cloud of sound that resets the memory and gives way to a new cycle. In the beginning, solo violin harmonics and bowed vibraphone play the first theme, gradually evolving into fragments of a new, but still related, theme.\n\n This second theme, inspired by Persian folk tunes, is scattered throughout the piece in fragments, echoing the nostalgia of my grandmother and the memories of her raising me in Iran. It is a tribute to the loving angel who was my grandmother, and only emerges in its entirety halfway through the piece, played by solo violin, and later culminates in a powerful climax in the final cycle. The piece concludes with a variation of the second theme followed by the recurring dream-like sound cloud, marking the end of the cycle.\n\n ~ I would like to dedicate this piece to my grandmother, Tahereh Moeini, who passed away shortly after composing the original mixed-ensemble version of this piece on August 5th, 2024. ~",

		"description": "Growing up in Iran, I had limited exposure to Western classical music. The music I encountered was primarily Iranian pop or traditional music, often heard on TV and radio. By chance, I discovered Tchaikovsky’s vibrant ballet scores, which ignited my passion for orchestral music. This marked the beginning of my journey into Western classical music, where I found inspiration in composers like Tchaikovsky and Mendelssohn. Inspired by the playful spirit of Tchaikovsky and the melodic richness of Mendelssohn, \"Aulos in Wonderland\" is a period composition - my homage to these two composers - that captures the simple joys, excitement, and boundless imagination of childhood. The music portrays an evocative journey through a whimsical land, reminiscent of classic fairy tales. The air thrums with the lilting melodies of the Aulos, an ancient Greek flute, as nymphs and fauns dance and frolic.",

		"description": "We all go through dark times. Times that we suffer from depression and anxiety, insecurities, internal conflicts, times that we struggle with our identities, and feel lost in the world; and no matter how hard we try, we feel stuck. But when we finally start to figure it out and see a path forward, hope and inner peace slowly take over the darkness and confusion. Our hearts fill with light, longing to move forward, while the wounds and scars will always remind us of our pasts, all the good and bad, all the sweet and bitter, and all the breakthroughs and internal struggles. Cool and Good aims to reflect this inflection point in one’s life; the personal progress that comes with breaking the walls of insecurity, dismantling the mental barriers, and shifting our focus toward the future.\n\n However, Cool and Good turned out to be more than just that as several incidents greatly influenced this piece. It was during writing this piece when the tragedy of flight 752 took place. It was a dark period as tensions between the U.S. and Iran were rising. The U.S. successfully targeted and assassinated Qasem Soleimani, an Iranian major general in the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps tied to terrorist activities. Soon after, there were rumors of retaliation and war. A few days later, Iranian military launched missiles against U.S. bases in Iraq, which caused even more fear and uncertainty. Hours after the retaliation, in the dawn of Jan. 7th, a Ukrainian passenger plane was erroneously identified as a hostile target and shot down by Iran just minutes after taking off from Tehran, killing all the 176 passengers on board. Most of the passengers were Iranian Canadians—and many of whom were graduate students studying in Canada—who were returning to Canada via Ukraine after the New Year holidays. As an Iranian immigrant living in the States, this tragedy hit me close to home, especially that I have many friends and family in Iran, including my father at the time. Moreover, many of the victims of this flight were friends of my friends from middle school and high school, through whom I heard their unfinished stories. It could have been any of my friends and family members on that flight. Many immigrants with hopes for better lives who instead ended up paying the price of absurd political games.\n\n This tragedy influenced me into rethinking the form and flow of the piece halfway through its composition. Although Cool and Good is not specifically about the tragedy of flight 752, it contains the emotions, effects, and shocks felt by this dreaded massacre. Nevertheless, despite all the darkness that had unfolded so quickly, including the COVID-19 pandemic that followed shortly after, I was adamant about making the general feel and the conclusion of the piece relatively optimistic; hoping that all the victims are in a better place. And that ending the piece darkly would be admitting defeat to the self-serving and corrupt politicians who make decisions at the cost of innocent lives.\n\n On a more technical note, Cool and Good draws inspiration from eastern, specifically, Persian music in formal development, treatment of time, and style of expression, while the harmonic language is based on simple triadic western classical music. The piece is based on the simple materials and the common chord progression of I – IV – V – I in the key of C major. This simple yet universal progression has been a major element of music throughout the history, and across all regions of the globe. It is also a common concept that represents human’s journey in its shortest form; the idea of starting from home (I), embarking on a journey that builds up tension (IV-V), and the return to home or the resolution (I). Additionally, quarter tones are slowly introduced to the piece, finding their ways into returning melodic material, indicating the imperfections and the unexpected in life. During the chaotic year of 2020, it felt just right to take a step back to the basics and base this piece on this simple and universal progression. Reflecting on our pasts and all its sweet and bitter memories, Cool and Good oscillates between light and darkness and ends with a cautiously hopeful and optimistic outlook on life.\n\n ~ I would like to dedicate this piece to the victims of flight 752, hoping that they are in a better place ~",

		"description": "\"Whirling, Onward…\" is a deeply personal compilation of the emotional landscape I navigated over the past few years prior to composing this piece. It portrays the anxious mind of a young adult, wrestling with determination to forge his own path, discover his destiny and purpose, find his people, understand himself, and ultimately make sense of life. This music echoes a mind constantly whirling, reflecting on all past and present events while acutely aware of, and concerned about, what the future holds. It embodies the countless small triumphs and setbacks of daily life, the clash of our hopes and fears, joys and regrets, strengths and weaknesses, and the vivid divide between fantasy and reality, all fueled by a yearning for happiness and fulfillment and a profound fear of loneliness.\n\n The composition is built upon three constantly evolving musical ideas, reappearing in new colors, characters, and moods, much like a stream of consciousness. It unfolds in three continuous parts:\n\n <strong>• Muse:</strong> Depicts the decision-making process; summoning the courage to simply try, not knowing what the outcome will be. Partial references to the main theme gradually culminate in its full emergence at the very end of the section, voiced by strings and celesta.\n\n <strong>• Whirling:</strong> Representing interactions with the physical world, this part illustrates our attempts in life—succeeding in some, failing in many. It is playful but volatile, unpredictable, and rapidly changing.\n\n <strong>• Onward:</strong> Commencing with Haydn’s Hornsignal Symphony—a concert within a concert—this serves as a reference to the external world, musically linked by a shared octave-jump motif. Earlier themes and motives are gradually layered over or interject, ultimately dramatically take over and draw the listener into a state of contemplation, disconnected from the physical world, looking deep within one's own heart and mind. Ultimately, a path forward becomes clear. The struggles and wounds of the past remain fresh, but now there is a distinct direction. There is focus. And there is renewed hope. \n\n I envision this piece as a solitary voyage to the moon, perhaps in a spaceship that cannot be stopped. Behind us is the Earth, where our past and memories reside. Ahead, the moon looms—daunting, unknown, and mysterious. During this unstoppable journey, we are left with thoughts of the past and the future, ceaselessly whirling in our minds.",

Partial references to the main theme gradually culminate in its full emergence at the very end of the section, voiced by strings and celesta.\n\n <strong>• Whirling:</strong> Representing interactions with the physical world, this part illustrates our attempts in life—succeeding in some, failing in many. It is playful but volatile, unpredictable, and rapidly changing.\n\n <strong>• Onward:</strong> Commencing with Haydn’s Hornsignal Symphony—a concert within a concert—this serves as a reference to the external world, musically linked by a shared octave-jump motif. Earlier themes and motives are gradually layered over or interject, ultimately dramatically take over and draw the listener into a state of contemplation, disconnected from the physical world, looking deep within one's own heart and mind. Ultimately, a path forward becomes clear. The struggles and wounds of the past remain fresh, but now there is a distinct direction. There is focus. And there is renewed hope. \n\n I envision this piece as a solitary voyage to the moon, perhaps in a spaceship that cannot be stopped. Behind us is the Earth, where our past and memories reside. Ahead, the moon looms—daunting, unknown, and mysterious. During this unstoppable journey, we are left with thoughts of the past and the future, ceaselessly whirling in our minds.",

		"description": "This piece explores themes of anxiety, loneliness, and darkness, inspired by challenging experiences during early college years in Los Angeles. It captures a period of intense pressure and isolation, ultimately reflecting a journey through adversity towards hope.\n\n The piece is divided into three movements: darkness, dream, and hope. Time, or the lack thereof, is a central theme, reflecting the constant pressure to achieve and the fleeting nature of life. The Westminster tune, a familiar melody, marks key moments in the piece, symbolizing the passage of time and the evolving character of the music. The final movement, a hopeful crescendo based on the Westminster tune, ultimately collapses into a moment of uncertainty, yet concludes with a glimmer of hope resonating through the final notes.",

		"description": "Drawing inspiration from the tranquil stillness of a quiet night, Breathing of Night is a short work for wind symphony that explores the inherent rhythms of the natural world. The composition is structured around two primary musical elements:\n\n <strong>• The Breathing Motif:</strong> Presented in a recurring 7/8 meter, this motif establishes the foundational pulse of the work, emblematic of the rhythmic oscillations of life and breathing.\n\n <strong>• The Melodic Theme:</strong> This lyrical theme, in a contrasting 3/8 meter, serves as the emotional core of the composition. It is introduced and developed throughout the piece, appearing in various textures and transformations.\n\n Listeners are encouraged to observe the interplay between these two musical ideas. The 'breathing motif' acts as a unifying thread, appearing in diverse orchestrations across the piece's sections. Concurrently, the 'melodic theme' unfolds expressively, guiding the listener through a narrative of quiet introspection.",
