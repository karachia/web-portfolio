		"description": "\"For Ava\" was originally conceived as the second movement of my Sonata for Double Bass and Piano, one of my earliest compositions. While it remains part of the larger work, I always felt the movement possessed a distinct voice that could stand on its own. Composed years after the rest of the sonata, it represents a more evolved chapter of my early writing. Because this music has a special place in my heart, I chose to revisit it as a standalone work. I have titled it For Ava, dedicated to Ava May Jensen, the newborn daughter of my dear friend and collaborator Tim Jensen—the bassist for whom the sonata was written and who premiered the original work.",

		"description": "\"Stranger of Kin\", inspired by my grandmother's Alzheimer's disease, which progressively worsened over the course of nine years, explores the complex emotions that arise when a loved one experiences memory loss. Our interactions are a mix of love, sadness at her moments of forgetfulness, and frustration when the same questions, like \"who are you?\", repeat. There are brief moments of joy, too, as she recalls a childhood memory of when she helped raise me like a second mother. But these precious moments are fleeting, and the cycle of confusion and questioning begins anew.\n\n At the same time, I imagine my grandmother feels fear and disorientation when she doesn't recognize her surroundings or the people around her. It must be a disorienting whirlwind for her, forced to rely on the explanations of a stranger (me) to understand her reality.

In the beginning, solo violin harmonics and bowed vibraphone play the first theme, gradually evolving into fragments of a new, but still related, theme.\n\n This second theme, inspired by Persian folk tunes, is scattered throughout the piece in fragments, echoing the nostalgia of my grandmother and the memories of her raising me in Iran. It is a tribute to the loving angel who was my grandmother, and only emerges in its entirety halfway through the piece, played by solo violin, and later culminates in a powerful climax in the final cycle.

By chance, I discovered Tchaikovsky’s vibrant ballet scores, which ignited my passion for orchestral music. This marked the beginning of my journey into Western classical music, where I found inspiration in composers like Tchaikovsky and Mendelssohn.\n\nInspired by the playful spirit of Tchaikovsky and the melodic richness of Mendelssohn, \"Aulos in Wonderland\" is a period composition - my homage to these two composers - that captures the simple joys, excitement, and boundless imagination of childhood. The music portrays an evocative journey through a whimsical land, reminiscent of classic fairy tales. The air thrums with the lilting melodies of the Aulos, an ancient Greek flute, as nymphs and fauns dance and frolic.",

		"dedication": "Dedicated to the victims of flight 752",
		"category": "Chamber",
		"description": "\"Cool & Good\" is a reflection on healing and growth after a prolonged period of personal struggles, internal conflicts, depression, and feeling lost and stuck. It represents hope and light seeping in, slowly taking over the darkness; growing inner peace and self-acceptance replacing the internal chaos. It is about wounds healing into scars. \n\nThis healing journey, however, was not without its challenges. While composing this piece, the tragedy of Ukraine International Airlines Flight 752 took place on January 8, 2020, where a passenger plane flying from Tehran to Kyiv was erroneously shot down by Iran in the aftermath of the assassination of Qasem Soleimani—an Iranian major general with ties to terrorist activities. Rumors of war ensued, followed by Iran targeting U.S. bases in Iraq in retaliation, which then led to this grave mistake that took the lives of all 176 people on board. \n\nAs an Iranian-American immigrant, this tragedy hit close to home. Most of the passengers on board were Iranian-Canadian immigrants returning to Canada via Ukraine after the New Year holidays. These were people with hopes for better lives outside of their home country who instead ended up paying the price of absurd political games. Many of them were college students studying in Canada; friends of my middle and high school friends, through whom I heard their unfinished stories. \n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic followed shortly thereafter—just a few months before graduating from college. Overnight, the world was shut down and the future seemed bleak. It was hard to feel hopeful during this time. While \"Cool & Good\" is not directly about the Flight 752 tragedy or the pandemic, it contains the emotions, effects, and shocks felt by both events, which influenced major changes to the form and tone of the piece mid-composition. Nevertheless, despite all the darkness that had unfolded so quickly, I was adamant about making the general feel and the conclusion of the piece hopeful and optimistic, especially to honor the victims of the Flight 752 massacre. \n\nGiven the unsettling times, it felt right to revert to the basics for writing \"Cool & Good\": sincere tunes in the cozy key of C major with simple triadic harmonies based on the prevalent and universal chord progression of I–IV–V–I; frequent repetitions and a slow unfolding of the musical material. A blend of Western harmonies with influences drawn from the lyricism and improvisational expressions found in traditional and folk Persian music. \n\nTo mark the imperfections and the unexpected in life, microtones sporadically make appearances throughout the piece in otherwise extremely tonal contexts. I became fascinated by how out of place and shocking a small microtonal deviation in a tonal context feels. One could even think of them as performance mistakes, or “deficiencies.” After some time, however, our subconscious starts to embrace them as if they always belonged there. It gives us much to learn about sympathy, forgiveness, and self-acceptance. \n\n\"Cool & Good\" marks a major point of personal breakthrough entangled with external setbacks. It reflects on the past and all the sweet and bitter memories, oscillating between light and darkness and ending with a cautiously hopeful and optimistic outlook on life. \n\n~ I would like to dedicate this piece to the victims of Flight 752, hoping that they are in a better place. ~",

		"description": "\"Cool & Good\" is a reflection on healing and growth after a prolonged period of personal struggles, internal conflicts, depression, and feeling lost and stuck. It represents hope and light seeping in, slowly taking over the darkness; growing inner peace and self-acceptance replacing the internal chaos. It is about wounds healing into scars. \n\nThis healing journey, however, was not without its challenges. While composing this piece, the tragedy of Ukraine International Airlines Flight 752 took place on January 8, 2020, where a passenger plane flying from Tehran to Kyiv was erroneously shot down by Iran in the aftermath of the assassination of Qasem Soleimani—an Iranian major general with ties to terrorist activities. Rumors of war ensued, followed by Iran targeting U.S. bases in Iraq in retaliation, which then led to this grave mistake that took the lives of all 176 people on board. \n\nAs an Iranian-American immigrant, this tragedy hit close to home. Most of the passengers on board were Iranian-Canadian immigrants returning to Canada via Ukraine after the New Year holidays. These were people with hopes for better lives outside of their home country who instead ended up paying the price of absurd political games. Many of them were college students studying in Canada; friends of my middle and high school friends, through whom I heard their unfinished stories. \n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic followed shortly thereafter—just a few months before graduating from college. Overnight, the world was shut down and the future seemed bleak. It was hard to feel hopeful during this time. While \"Cool & Good\" is not directly about the Flight 752 tragedy or the pandemic, it contains the emotions, effects, and shocks felt by both events, which influenced major changes to the form and tone of the piece mid-composition. Nevertheless, despite all the darkness that had unfolded so quickly, I was adamant about making the general feel and the conclusion of the piece hopeful and optimistic, especially to honor the victims of the Flight 752 massacre. \n\nGiven the unsettling times, it felt right to revert to the basics for writing \"Cool & Good\": sincere tunes in the cozy key of C major with simple triadic harmonies based on the prevalent and universal chord progression of I–IV–V–I; frequent repetitions and a slow unfolding of the musical material. A blend of Western harmonies with influences drawn from the lyricism and improvisational expressions found in traditional and folk Persian music. \n\nTo mark the imperfections and the unexpected in life, microtones sporadically make appearances throughout the piece in otherwise extremely tonal contexts. I became fascinated by how out of place and shocking a small microtonal deviation in a tonal context feels. One could even think of them as performance mistakes, or “deficiencies.” After some time, however, our subconscious starts to embrace them as if they always belonged there. It gives us much to learn about sympathy, forgiveness, and self-acceptance. \n\n\"Cool & Good\" marks a major point of personal breakthrough entangled with external setbacks. It reflects on the past and all the sweet and bitter memories, oscillating between light and darkness and ending with a cautiously hopeful and optimistic outlook on life. \n\n~ I would like to dedicate this piece to the victims of Flight 752, hoping that they are in a better place. ~",

		"description": "\"Whirling, Onward…\" is a deeply personal compilation of the emotional landscape I navigated over the past few years prior to composing this piece. It portrays the anxious mind of a young adult, wrestling with determination to forge his own path, discover his destiny and purpose, find his people, understand himself, and ultimately make sense of life. This music echoes a mind constantly whirling, reflecting on all past and present events while acutely aware of, and concerned about, what the future holds. It embodies the countless small triumphs and setbacks of daily life, the clash of our hopes and fears, joys and regrets, strengths and weaknesses, and the vivid divide between fantasy and reality, all fueled by a yearning for happiness and fulfillment and a profound fear of loneliness.\n\n The composition is built upon three constantly evolving musical ideas, reappearing in new colors, characters, and moods, much like a stream of consciousness. It unfolds in three continuous parts:\n\n <strong>• Muse:</strong> Depicts the decision-making process; summoning the courage to simply try, not knowing what the outcome will be. Partial references to the main theme gradually culminate in its full emergence at the very end of the section, voiced by strings and celesta.\n\n <strong>• Whirling:</strong> Representing interactions with the physical world, this part illustrates our attempts in life—succeeding in some, failing in many. It is playful but volatile, unpredictable, and rapidly changing.\n\n <strong>• Onward:</strong> Commencing with Haydn’s Hornsignal Symphony—a concert within a concert—this serves as a reference to the external world, musically linked by a shared octave-jump motif. Earlier themes and motives are gradually layered over or interject, ultimately dramatically take over and draw the listener into a state of contemplation, disconnected from the physical world, looking deep within one's own heart and mind. Ultimately, a path forward becomes clear. The struggles and wounds of the past remain fresh, but now there is a distinct direction. There is focus. And there is renewed hope. \n\n I envision this piece as a solitary voyage to the moon, perhaps in a spaceship that cannot be stopped. Behind us is the Earth, where our past and memories reside. Ahead, the moon looms—daunting, unknown, and mysterious. During this unstoppable journey, we are left with thoughts of the past and the future, ceaselessly whirling in our minds.",

It served as a cathartic exploration of my experiences and a means of coping with the challenges I faced. The darkness of the first movement turns into a dream, seeking answers and balance, which then flows into the last movement: a crescendo in quest of hope. Time, or the lack thereof, is a central theme, reflecting the constant pressure to make it in life and its fleeting nature. The familiar Westminster tune, marks key moments in the piece, symbolizing certain hours of the day and the passage of time.",

The composition is structured around two primary musical elements:\n\n <strong>• The Breathing Motif:</strong> Presented in a recurring 7/8 meter, this motif establishes the foundational pulse of the work, emblematic of the rhythmic oscillations of life and breathing.\n\n <strong>• The Melodic Theme:</strong> This lyrical theme, in a contrasting 3/8 meter, serves as the emotional core of the composition. It is introduced and developed throughout the piece, appearing in various textures and transformations.\n\n Listeners are encouraged to observe the interplay between these two musical ideas. The 'breathing motif' acts as a unifying thread, appearing in diverse orchestrations across the piece's sections. Concurrently, the 'melodic theme' unfolds expressively, guiding the listener through a narrative of quiet introspection.",
